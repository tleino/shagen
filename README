This is a simple program to generate passwords and passphrases
based on a master passphrase.

Because all that is generated is based on a master passphrase, it
does not need to store anything. The security is therefore highly
relying on the strength of the master passphrase. The master
passphrase's strength should at least be equal to a 6-word diceware
passphrase which is 77.5 bits.

How it works:

We use one-way SHA256 cryptographic hash function in combination
with the master passphrase and account details. The SHA256 gives
us 256 bits to work with. We extract 224 bits for passwords and
192 bits for passphrases. These bits are then mapped to symbol
and word lists giving us roughly 77 bits passwords and passphrases.

Security considerations:

When compared to a traditional password vault, the advantage is
we no longer need to care about encrypting, decrypting, backing up
and copying the vault file, and the disadvantage is that the
passwords and passphrases are derived from a master passphrase.

This means, whoever has even one password or passphrase, can attempt
to offline brute force the master passphrase, and if they succeed,
they essentially get all the passwords and passphrases. However, if
the master passphrase is strong enough, this is not a problem.
