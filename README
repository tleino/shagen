This is a simple program to generate passwords based on a master
passphrase.

Because all that is generated is based on a master passphrase, it
does not need to store anything. The security is therefore highly
relying on the strength of the master passphrase. The master
passphrase's strength should at least be equal to a 6-word diceware
passphrase which is 77.5 bits.

How it works:

We use one-way SHA256 cryptographic hash function in combination
with the master passphrase and account details. The SHA256 gives
us 256 bits to work with. We extract 224 bits. These bits are then
mapped to a password symbol list giving us ~76 bits passwords.
